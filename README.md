#### To push the code in gitlab you can follow these steps

1. Create Project and Name the project as  **Case_Study01_Analog_Watch** in your local machine

2. Navigate to Hackathon2k20_analogWatch folder

    `cd Case_Study01_Analog_Watch`

3. Remove its remote or original reference

     `git remote rm origin`

4. Create a new repo in gitlab named `Case_Study01_Analog_Watch` as private repo

5. Add your new repository reference as remote

     `git remote add origin https://gitlab-cgi.stackroute.in/{{yourusername}}/Case_Study01_Analog_Watch.git`

     **Note: {{yourusername}} should be replaced by your username from gitlab**

5. Check the status of your repo 
     
     `git status`

6. Use the following command to update the index using the current content found in the working tree, to prepare the content staged for the next commit.

     `git add .`
 
7. Commit and Push the project to git

     `git commit -a -m "Initial commit | or place your comments according to your need"`

     `git push -u origin master`

8. Check on the git repo online, if the files have been pushed
